Was in Paris for a week with my son and he wanted to spend a day at the Louvre. We made sure to take in the major works like the Mona Lisa. Afterwards, we walked 
over to the oldest patisserie in Paris and bought some macarons. This photo bothers me ever so slightly for standing in the wrong place. I should've
stepped to the left about one foot so as to have the pyramids line up properly.
