The first (and so far only) time I went to Iceland was for a photography workshop. It was mostly an excuse to travel to somewhere interesting but it was also advantageous
to have someone plan places for us to visit. We explored one of the western peninsulas and came across this house sitting out on the edge of a small lake. The backdrop
of the hillly outcrop with the low clouds was absolutely stunning. Also interesting to note was how many awful photos before I took something that was half decent.
