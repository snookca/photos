From Portland to Ottawa, from house to condo. This piece felt like a good fit for the officeâ€”my sanctuary. My condo is full of patterns
and the horizontal and vertical lines of this piece, along with the warm colours, really lent themselves to this space. Now to have a seat, 
with a glass of whisky in hand, and enjoy some jazz.
