Sitting in a park, I found myself looking up at this building and imagining myself living in them. 
What must it be like to stand on the balcony and look out over this park? What would it have been like 
a hundred years ago, looking out over the same park? What about two hundred years ago? Were I to have 
a time machine, it is the mundane daily life that I would find myself captivated with.
